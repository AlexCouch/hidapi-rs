# hidapi_rust [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/hidapi_rust.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/hidapi_rust) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ruabmbua/hidapi_rust.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ruabmbua/hidapi_rust) #

This crate provides a rust abstraction over the features of the C library
[hidapi](https://github.com/signal11/hidapi) by signal11.

This crate is a work in progress, but I already use it for one of my own
projects, which does not need more functionality. Feel free to send pull
requests, to improve the API, and add missing features.
